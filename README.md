## ARTWORK AUCTION NFT
ARTWORK AUCTION NFT is a platform for managing the sale of works 
of art through a charity auction that interacts with
two smart contracts distributed on Ganache and created, c
ompiled with Remix Ide, an Token erc20 that will be used as a spendable currency 
and an token erc721 used to create works of art nft.

To enter the platform and start bidding and purchasing artwork,
there are two pages for user registration and login. The platform provides each user with a random amount of $ upon registration and 10 FeroToken.

Within the platform only the administrator can create the NFT artwork.

To start bidding on artwork, any user can convert dollars into FeroToken. 10 $ equals 1 Ferotoken.
At the end of an auction, the database will receive and save all information about the auction and the winner.
